# Michelson Interferometer Simulator
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# This code was developed collaboratively by
# Prof. Francisco Geraldo and assistant ChatGPT,

# Objective:
# To implement an interactive simulation of the operating principle
# of a Michelson interferometer, including:
# - wave superposition;
# - phase variation induced by mirror displacement;
# - resulting intensity at each position;
# - intensity at the center as a function of displacement.

# Note: This code is part of the effort to develop computational teaching materials
# for teaching optical interferometry
# in the Physics course at UECE.
